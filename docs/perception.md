A typical person will describe numbers, shapes, and colors upon seeing this image. I myself can only see two out of the six numbers. What others may perceive as vibrant scarlets, luscious greens, or warm burgundys, would be perceived by myself as shades and derivations of brown. Now close your eyes, and imagine the color blue. How would you describe the color blue? If you are an individual without sight, or had to explain it to someone without sight, how would you describe it to them? This being said, it is very likely that we all do see the same colors, but how we perceive them may be completely different. The point of this exercise is to bring up the question: how do you describe things? Naturally, you describe them in terms relative to other things. 

For example, we describe size in terms of space, velocity in terms of space and time, and flavor in terms of taste. The one thing that we are unable to describe in terms of other things is our consciousness. Imagine a state in which you've lost all of your senses. The only thing left would be your consciousness. That consciousness, or our self of self, our existence, is the only concept we may treat as given.
