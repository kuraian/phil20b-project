Hello and welcome to Ryan Diep's PHIL 20B final project.

The goal of this project is to provide a compelling argument, using readings from the coursework, as to why metaphysics is unsolveable by humans.

This is a modification of my original visual/interactive idea. Images/boxes will be replaced with different web pages.

Thesis: Metaphysics is *unsolveable*

if you're reading this you're either my professor or searched my username up on google.
have a nice day either way

this was my tutorial project for learning how to use gitbash, jekyll, and work with ruby gems

perhaps it is too pessimistic to believe that the universe is beyond humanity, so alternative thesis here: humans have potential to overcome their scope of understanding but will die out aeons before science reaches that point.
