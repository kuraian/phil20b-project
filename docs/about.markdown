Hello and welcome to Ryan Diep's PHIL 20B final project.

The goal of this project is to provide a compelling argument, using readings from the coursework, as to why metaphysics is unsolveable by humans.

This is a modification of my original visual/interactive idea. Images/boxes will be replaced with different web pages.

Thesis: Metaphysics is *unsolveable*

-topics covered: 
	-Descartes + Spinoza: God
	-Leibniz: Monads, soul, body, God
	-Hume: skepticism, empiricism
	-Kant: a priori metaphysics, spacetime

plan: descartes, spinoza, leibniz lead to endless loop, hume leads to 404, kant (?)
