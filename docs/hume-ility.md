What made Socrates the wisest man in all of Athens was not insurmountable amounts of knowledge, but his acknowledgement of not knowing anything.

With this, I return to my thesis: metaphysics is unsolvable through human means. The true solution and path in philosophy lies in grounded science and experience, and even then we must have a degree of skepticism towards its veracity. Just as the ancients lacked perspective to understand the solar system, we most definitely lack perspective to define the universe. Even at the peak, we may find complete understanding of our universe, but we could never be certain that it is, indeed, the universe. Thus: truly understanding the universe requires perception beyond us.

It is foolish to reach beyond human capacity and try to understand things in our own terms. The only way forward is paved by accumulating experience, and that road will inevitably reach an end. When that end is reached, if it is surpassed, we will no longer be Human.



P.S. maybe too many Hume-puns. Hume-ans pictures below. (mere frogs in a well)
