DISCLAIMER: THIS IS IN NO WAY OR FORM MEANT TO DEMEAN INDIVIDUALS AND/OR THEIR RELIGIOUS BELIEFS

Do you believe in God? Of all the answers towards the subject of metaphysics, perhaps God is the least compelling of them all. 

"I think, therefore I am." -Descartes

Of the religious foundationalist philosophers, perhaps the best known line is this. I agree in that we may take ourselves as a priori, and thus posit concepts such as space and time as Kant has. To take oneself as a foundation is surely sound, and perhaps may be the only concept that we may understand a priori. In fact, I will double down on that statement: the only concept I acknowledge to be understood as a priori is oneself. If one does not consider oneself in such a manner, then it invalidates all knowledge gained a posteriori. That being said, let us return to the original question. Do you believe in God?

If you do, continue [here.](https://kuraian.github.io/phil20b-project/)

If you have followed the link, you would see that it brought you to the beginning. Just like any argument that has God as its basis, everything will return to the beginning: God. There is no logical basis for one to claim the existence of God. Conversely, there is also no logical basis for one to deny the existence of God. With this point, I mean to say that I neither acknowldge nor deny a God; if such a God exists then They must exist outside of our realm of perception. 

In defense of this claim, let us examine Leibniz's statement that God, in his holiness, must have created this world in its best possible form. A common argument by Atheists is that evil may not coexist with God, therefore God is not real because He has created a world rife with evil. A common counterargument is that good and evil scale infinitely and may not be measured by humans, similarly to how one could count numbers infinitely in either direction. Therefore, God created this world with a level of evil approaching nil. This argument could go on eternally; yet one thing can be drawn from this argument. If it is agreed that infinity is beyond the realm of humans, and that it is instead the domain of Gods and higher beings, then we shall remain eternally clueless regarding such concepts.
