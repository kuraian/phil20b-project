hello welcome to Ryan Diep's PHIL 20B final project

current working idea: circular path of "continues" that will never reach an endpoint

This is a modification of my original visual/interactive idea. Images/boxes will be replaced with different web pages.

Current thesis: metaphysics is unsolveable

topics covered: (descartes + spinoza: god) + (leibniz: monads, soul, body, god), (hume: skepticism, empiricism), (kant: a priori metaphysics, spacetime)

plan: descartes, spinoza, leibniz lead to endless loop, hume leads to 404, kant (?)

I agree most with hume's stance on metaphysics...
